In this example, the chatbot is trained on the English language corpus included with ChatterBot. This means that it will have a basic understanding of English grammar and vocabulary, and will be able to generate responses to a wide range of questions.

You can also train a complex chatbot on your own data to create a custom conversation model. This can be useful if you want the chatbot to have domain-specific knowledge or if you want it to use a specific writing style.
